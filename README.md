### Design Thinking

Design Thinking seeks to see everything through the user's eyes.

### Agile Methodology

Agile Methodology allows you create things continuosly and establish an improvement process each time a product is delivered.

### Lean Startup

Lean Startup seeks to bring ideas as soon as possible to the market to obtain feedback and work in the continuous improvement of the product 

## LEAN UX Principles

LEAN UX principles help us establish a new work culture for ourselves.
